    "# OOP:  Classes, Objects, and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. Classes encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is a function defined within a class that operates on the data contained in the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every class definition starts with the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. The body of the class contains attributes and methods that define the behavior of the class and are only available within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `__init__` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated from a class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object and is often referred to as the constructor. It takes `self` as the first parameter, which refers to the instance being created, and can take additional parameters to set the initial state of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):\n",
    "        self.attribute1 = attribute1\n",
    "        self.attribute2 = attribute2\n",
    "```\n",
    "This method must be defined in every class if you want to initialize attributes when creating an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation\n",
    "Data is what we call attributes, and methods are functions that operate on those attributes. Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within one unit, or class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows for data hiding, where the internal representation of the object is hidden from the outside. This is done by defining methods that provide access to the data without exposing the data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attributes in Python\n",
    "Attributes are variables that belong to an object. They are defined within the class and can be accessed using the `self` keyword, which refers to the instance of the class.\n",
    "we have `public`, `protected`, `private` and `class` attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Public attributes` are accessible from outside the class. Define them without any leading underscores.\n",
    "- `Protected attributes` are not accessible from outside the class, but can be accessed by subclasses. Define them with a leading underscore.\n",
    "- `Private attributes` are not accessible from outside the class and are intended to be used only within the class. Define them with two leading underscores.\n",
    "- `Class attributes` are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside any instance methods. Access them using the class name or an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods in Python\n",
    "Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the attributes of the class. They can be called on instances of the class and can access and modify the instance's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods can be categorized as:\n",
    "- **Instance methods**: The most common type of method, which takes `self` as the first parameter and operates on the instance's attributes.\n",
    "- **Class methods**: Defined with the `@classmethod` decorator, these methods take `cls` as the first parameter and can access class attributes. They are used to create factory methods or alternative constructors.\n",
    "- **Static methods**: Defined with the `@staticmethod` decorator, these methods do not take `self` or `cls` as the first parameter. They are used for utility functions that do not need access to instance or class data and can be called on the class itself or an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*May not come in the 'Vorlesung' but are still important to understand for later on (PPR)*\n"

It enables methods to be used interchangeably across different classes, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in code.
