    "# How to `print()`\n",

    "#### 1. Basic Printing\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also print numbers or variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    name = \"Alex\"\n",
    "    print(name)         # Alex\n",
    "    print(2 + 2)        # 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Printing Multiple Items\n",
    "In this way, a blank is automatically added between each one of the words before printing. This way we dont have to take care about the `type` of thing we want to print, Python takes care of that.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\", \"world\", 2025) # Output: Hello world 2025\n",

    "#### 3. Using `+` to Concatenate Strings\n",

Using this method we are able to write clear strings and the output is exactly what we write, also... No more type handling ðŸ˜‰, do i need to say anything else? You are not convinced yet? You can also call functions, yes, functions from whithin the brackets."
